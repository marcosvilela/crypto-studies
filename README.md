# Cryptography Studies
A repository for studies in the field of Cryptography. It includes implementations of Caesar's Cypher in both Java and Python.

# Python Implementation
The python implementation is less stiff than the Java one. It allows you to variate the substitution cypher, both by choosing the shift value and setting it on the middle value (as in the ROT13 algorithm)

# Java Implementation

The Java implementation is a simple class used to cypher a text with the classic shift value of 3.
